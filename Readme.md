# STATS CATEGORY ORDER
## Create a macro or multiple dichotomy set with a specified variable order
 This procedure takes a list of ordinary variables or multiple dichotomy sets.  For ordinary variables, it creates a macro listing the variables in sorted order of the count.  This macro can be used in the CTABLES CATEGORIES subcommand to control the order in the table.  Unlike CTABLES, it can move special values out of the sort order.  For multiple dichotomy sets, it creates a new set with the categories similarly reordered.
