<h1>Create Macros or Multiple Dichotomy Sets to Control Category Order</h1>
This procedure creates macro definitions or multiple dichotomy sets for use
in Custom Tables in order to control the category order beyond what is built
in to that procedure.  For ordinary variables (not multiple dichotomy sets),
it can also create custom attributes holding the order that can be used
with Python programmability.

<p>The procedure processes two types of input.  For an ordinary variable
it creates a macro definition that lists the categories in sorted order of
the counts with the ability to move selected values to the top or bottom
of the list.  A typical usage would be to move an "other" category to the
bottom.  The generated macro can be used in the CTABLES CATEGORIES
subcommand to specify the order.  With a custom attribute, the subcommand
syntax could be generated using Python code.</p>
<p>The second type of input is one or more multiple dichotomy sets.  An
MD set consists of a group of variables representing choices or attributes
as yes (the counted value) or no for each attribute.  The procedure
creates a new MD set consisting of the same variable plus optionally
other similar variables with the variables listed in sorted count
order.  By specifying special variables, typically but not
necessarily included in the set definition, those variables can be moved
to the top or bottom of the list.  Tabulating the new sets with custom tables
will list the variables in the order generated by this procedure.</p>
<p>
<p class="bullet">• Both regular variables and MD sets can be processed
at the same time, each according to the specifications for its type.</p>
<p class="bullet">• This procedure is mainly useful for CTABLES,
but it may also be useful for MD sets in GGRAPH.</p>
<p class="bullet">• The procedure cannot be used with multiple category
sets, but the STATS MCSET CONVERT extension command can convert an MC set
into an MD set.</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Variables and MD Sets</span> 
Select the variables and multiple dichotomy sets to process.  A macro
will be created for each variable selected; an MD set will be created
for each set selected.</p>
<p class="bullet">• All variables selected either directly or as
set members must have the same fundamental type (numeric or string).</p>
</p>
<p><span class="runinhead">Special Values</span> 
Enter the values that are special for ordinary variables.  Separate
values by a blank.  String values should be enclosed in quotes
if they contain a blank.  Special values or variables will be
moved out of the sort order according to the specifications
in Options.</p>
<p class="bullet">• These values have no effect on MD sets.
</p>


<p><span class="runinhead">Special Variables</span> Select the
variables that contain special values, e.g., an "other" variable
for MD sets.  These variables will be moved out of the sort
order according to the specifications in Options when the new
sets are defined.</p>
<p class="bullet">• These values have no effect on ordinary variables.
</p>
<p><span class="runinhead">Values Not Found in Data and Empty Set Variables</span> 
For ordinary variables, check the box to add 
labeled values that are not found in the data to the results with a count of zero.  
If missing values are excluded, labeled missing values are omitted.</p>
<p>For sets, this causes component variables of the sets with a count of zero
to be grouped with the other set variables.  It only makes a difference if there
are special variables defined.</p>
<p><span class="runinhead">Macro or MD Set Names</span> This
box defines the names of the items created.  If you enter a
prefix, the output names will have the form<br>
prefix_inputname<br>
Alternatively, you can enter a list of names for the outputs.
Enter as many names as there are variables and sets selected.
For a macro definition, a "!" will be prepended to the name.
for an MD set, a "$" will be prepended.</p>
<p class="bullet">• An existing variable or set having the same
name as an output name will be replaced, except that an error will
occur if the type of the existing variable is not consistent with the
type of the new output.</p>
<p>If None is selected, specify a custom attribute in the Custom Attribute box.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Custom Attribute for Category Order</span> Check
the box to create a custom attribute for each variable specifying the order.
This can be used in Python code to generate the appropriate CTABLES syntax.
Custom attributes can be displayed in the Data Editor Variable View and
other places.
They are saved with the dataset, obviating the need to redo the calculation
in a future session unless the data have changed.</p>
<p><span class="runinhead">Name</span> You can specify the name for
the custom attribute in this control.</p>
<p>Here is an example using the custom attribute with Python</p>

<p><span class="code">
STATS CATEGORY ORDER items=jobcat customattr=yes.</br>
begin program.</br>
import spss, spssaux</br>
</br>
order = spssaux.VariableDict()['jobcat'].Attributes["ORDER"]</br>
cmd="""ctables /table jobcat</br>
/categories variables=jobcat [%s]""" % order</br>
spss.Submit(cmd)</br>
end program.</br>
</span>
<h2>Options</h2>

<p><span class="runinhead">Order</span> Select descending or
ascending.  The categories or set variables will be listed by
their count in the selected direction except for specials.</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Special Values Location</span> Any special
values or variables are moved either to the end of the list or the beginning
according to this specification.
</p>
<p><span class="runinhead">User Missing Values</span> Choose whether user
missing values in the data or labels are counted or ignored.  
This setting is applied to each variable individually.  If a special
value is also a missing value, it will be included regardless of this
setting.  System missing values are always ignored. </p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Category Labels</span> For MD sets only,
choose whether the variable labels of the set variables or the label
of the counted values is used to label the set.  This would
ordinarilly be the same as the specification used when the input
set was created.</p>

<h2>Additional Features</h2>
<p>
This dialog generates syntax for the STATS CATEGORY ORDER extension command. To display syntax help for this command,
run the following syntax:
</p>
<p class="codeblock">STATS CATEGORY ORDER /HELP.</p>
<p>Using syntax, you can create a macro that lists a set of variables in order of
the frequency of a set of specified values.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
This command requires the Python Essentials
You can download these via the SPSS Community website at www.ibm.com/developerworks/spssdevcentral
or from your installation materials.</p>
